# Node JS Real Time Chat

Inspired by [node js project ideas for beginners](https://www.blog.duomly.com/node-js-project-ideas-for-beginners/).

>Another exciting project that you could do to practice your Node JS skills is a real-time chat application. 
>For this purpose, you could try using a MongoDB, Express.js framework, and socket.io for real-time events. 
>In the beginning, itâ€™s good to create a simple chat that will connect and disconnect users, allow them to send and receive the messages, but in the future, it can be a great idea to grow the chat and add video streaming or login form.
>If you need some help in starting your first real-time chat app, take a look at the SocketIO documentation.
